**Questions to help teams assess the operability of software systems**

There is one main file:

1. [`operability-questions.md`](operability-questions.md) - the main set of questions to assess operability

## Overview

This repository holds a set of **operability questions** that are useful for assessing the operability of software systems. The operability questions can be used alone or in conjunction with tools like the [Run Book dialogue sheet](http://runbooktemplate.info/) to help discover additional operability criteria or gaps.

Each operability question requires answers to these key questions: 

* **Who? (What?)**: What kind of user or persona will do this? (Or what kind of system?) 
* **How?**: Which tool (or set of tools) or process will help to do this?
* **Evidence**:  How will you demonstrate this using evidence?

For each operability question, there is a short description of why this question is useful, giving some context.

For teams and people new to assessing operability, it can be very effective to print the [operability questions page](operability-questions.md) and record questions using pen & paper around a table; this helps teams to "step back" from the computer systems and consider operability more carefully.

> The book [Team Guide to Software Operability](http://operabilitybook.com/) has a section on Operability Questions, including details of how different teams use these questions to help improve operability.

## How to use the operability questions

1. Clone/fork the repo
1. Edit the file [`operability-questions.md`](operability-questions.md) 
1. Add your own operability questions - send us a Pull Request if you think your new checks are useful to others!
1. Remove (or comment with _N/A_) those sections that really do not apply in your case (but double-check first).
1. Use the template as a way to encourage discussion and collaboration between Devs and Ops people for building better systems.
1. If some information is missing for one or more sections, indicate this clearly (e.g. *WARNING*). Knowing what you do not know is valuable.
1. After you have validated the questions with all teams involved, begin to automate the checks and procedures.

**Expect to redesign parts of the software in order to better meet the operational needs outlined in these operability questions.**
