# Operability Questions

See [`README.md`](README.md) for more details on how to use these questions.

These **operability questions** are useful for assessing the operability of software systems. The operability questions can be used alone or in conjunction with tools like the [Run Book dialogue sheet](http://runbooktemplate.info/) to help discover additional operability criteria or gaps.

Each question requires answers to these key questions: 

* **Who? (What?)**: What kind of user or persona will do this? (Or what kind of system?) 
* **How?**: Which tool (or set of tools) or process will help to do this?
* **Evidence**:  How will you demonstrate this using evidence?
