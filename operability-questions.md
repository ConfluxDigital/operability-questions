# Operability Questions

These **operability questions** are useful for assessing the operability of software systems. The operability questions can be used alone or in conjunction with tools like the [Run Book dialogue sheet](http://runbooktemplate.info/) to help discover additional operability criteria or gaps.

Each question requires answers to these 

* By whom?
    * What kind of user or persona will do this?
* With what? 
    * Which tool or set of tools?
* ???
